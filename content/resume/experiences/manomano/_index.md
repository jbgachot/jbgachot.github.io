FinOps Engineer / Staff SRE

I joined a cross-functional platform team with the mission to empower the company through finops, observability, incident management, chaos engineering, and greenops. Primarily responsible for the finops pillar, I had the opportunity to:

- Conceptualize and develop platform tools to promote these five practices within the tech department.
- Help engineers better understand and control the costs of SaaS-based solutions.
- Identify waste and govern resource usage through automated assessments of running resources.
- Automate cloud commitments using predictive models.
