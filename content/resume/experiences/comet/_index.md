Lead SRE / DevOps

I enrolled at Comet as the first SRE, where I had the opportunity to revamp the entire stack, using automation at every stage of the infrastructure. Additionally, in my devops role, I worked closely with development teams to promote best practices around development and facilitate automated deployments.
