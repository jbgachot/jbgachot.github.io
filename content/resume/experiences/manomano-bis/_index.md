Platform Engineering Manager / Senior Lead SRE

I led a cross-functional team responsible for five key pillars: observability, chaos engineering, incident management, finops, and greenops.

My focus was on cultivating a product mindset to deliver impactful solutions for Engineering teams. I oversaw multiple roadmaps and product visions, ensuring user-centricity throughout the development process. Additionally, I assisted with coding, UX, and UI design to drive cohesive, high-quality outcomes.
