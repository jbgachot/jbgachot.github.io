Platform Staff Engineer

Reporting to the Head of Operational Excellence, I ensure the platform is reliable, scalable, secure, and largely automated. I contribute to the implementation of best practices, optimize performance, and drive continuous improvement, with a focus on finops, incident management, chaos engineering, and observability.

Ultimately, my goal is to deliver a comprehensive, "all-in-one" product that encapsulates the entire platform offering.
